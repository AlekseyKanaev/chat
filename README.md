This is my toy project, written in rust. I also added very basic frontend, written in flutter, it's web build is in *flutter_web_build* folder. If you will use flutter front for testing, you shuold use localhost:3030 for http and localhost:30366, because these are hardcoded into flutter source code. I know that this is bad practise, but I very new to flutter dev and don't want to spend more time on researching the matter. Please, use config.yaml to define those params.
